        <h1>FAQ / Contact</h1>
        
        <div class="qna">
          
          <p class="question">What are some of the conventions you have adopted in your transcriptions, and is there anything else we should know about your approach?</p>

          <p class="answer">The four themes played in a continuous loop in the game (i.e. the Overworld / Main Theme, the Underworld Theme, the Underwater Theme, and the Castle Theme) have been transcribed with a repeat bar, and their respective midi files and video demos repeat only once (i.e. 2 iterations are played in total).</p>

          <p class="answer">Fingering suggestions are only present for note patterns that have not already been encountered in that same piece. In other words, if there are no fingering suggestions, then this means you are back in familiar territory. All you really need to learn are those passages bearing fingering suggestions.</p>

          <p class="answer">Notes have been separated between the two staffs in such a way that the bottom staff is the exclusive realm of the left hand, and the top staff is the exclusive realm of the right hand. This is true regardless of which clef (bass or treble) is used on each staff, and there should never be a need to have the left hand play any of the notes written on the top staff, nor for the right hand to play any of the notes written on the bottom staff.</p>

          <p class="answer">Rests have been treated with the same respect as notes, and great care was taken to not transcribe a note to last any longer than it was held in the original recording. To improve readability, staccato marks (a dot above/below note heads) were sometimes used instead of rests; in these cases, for maximum fidelity, notes with staccato marks should be held for exactly half of their value, e.g. a staccato quarter note should be played as an eighth note followed by an eighth rest.</p>

          <p class="answer">The decision to mostly use the 2/2 time signature instead of 4/4 was a difficult one, fraught with tradeoffs. It is true that 4/4 would indeed have been more compact on the page, and some more advanced sight-readers contend that it is easier to parse, though this is likely because they have been exposed to 4/4 much more frequently than 2/2 in their musical past. To most readers, the sheet music in 2/2 actually improves readability considerably. That said, the two time signatures are not entirely interchangeable and there is an actual musical difference that goes beyond the question of readability: in 4/4, beats 1 and 3 of each measure are both considered strong beats, but beat 1 is also considered to be slightly stronger than beat 3. On the other hand, when these measures are split in half in 2/2, the beats formerly known as beats 1 and 3 of one 4/4 measure are now both first beats of two 2/2 measures, and are now therefore of equal strength. Having these beats of equal strength is what we need when representing a musical piece that feels like a march (with the left-right-left-right feel of a brisk walk), and the Main Theme and several others appear to be marches. Now, because the NES treated every beat the same way, no one can really be wrong in a debate over which of these two time signature most faithfully embodies the original recording.</p>

          <p class="answer">One piece of trivia: have you noticed that no more than 3 notes are ever player or held at any one time? This reflects the hardware constraints of the sound module used in the NES, and within which music composers had to operate at the time.</p>

          <p class="answer">I will confess to having taken one minor editorial liberty which, though probably very close to the composer's original intent as he was essentially writing a fast waltz, has no basis in the original recording: I am talking about the slur marks hovering all over the Underwater Theme - some of them very dramatically shaped, I might add. Obviously notes were not this expressively linked in the original recording, but since these slurs can easily be ignored by the reader, I simply could not resist including them, if only for aesthetic reasons. However, feel free to pretend that they are merely trails left behind by Mario or Luigi swimming across the page!</p>

        <div class="qna">
          
          <p class="question">Have you really transcribed every single sound effect from the 1985 game? What about the jump sound, the swim stroke sound, the brick smashing sound, the head banging sound, the fireball sound, the enemy flattening sound, the shell kick sound, the cannonball sound, the flame sound, and the sound of Bowser falling off the vanishing bridge?</p>
          
          <p class="answer">These sound effects were all delightful coming out of the NES, but when it comes to playing them on the piano (which is the exclusive scope of this website), it turns out that each of these sounds is either unplayable and/or unrecognizable.</p>
          
          <p class="answer">Those sound effects that are unplayable are unplayable because they contain a portamento, which is a <em>slide</em> from one pitch to another where the pitch changes <em>continuously</em> through an <em>infinite</em> number of intermediary pitches, and which is an effect that the piano instrument is simply incapable of producing. An electronic keyboard with a pitch bend wheel can achieve this effect, but not a traditional piano; indeed the closest thing to a portamento that a piano can do is a glissando, which is a <em>scale</em> from one pitch to another where the pitch changes in <em>discrete</em> steps through a <em>finite</em> number of intermediary pitches; on the piano, a glissando is achieved by quickly sliding one's hand across the keys, just like at the start of the Flagpole Fanfare.</p>
          
          <p class="answer">As for those sound effects that are unrecognizable, they are unrecognizable because their identity is primarily shaped by their timbre and hardly at all by their melody. In other words, they are produced by instruments or noise generators that sound nothing like the piano, and, in addition to that, these sound effects are hardly chromatic or rhythmic; that is, it is difficult to identify them as having any particular pitch, or they are made up of far too few pitches with hardly any rhythm, forming far too unrecognizable a melodic pattern. Therefore, even if their pseudo-melody were transcribed as accurately as possible, playing these transcriptions on the piano would not sound at all like the sound effect in question.</p>

        <div class="qna">
          
          <p class="question">Which music notation software did you use to engrave these transcriptions, and where can I find it?</p>
          
          <p class="answer">I used MakeMusic's Finale. Finale is available for both Windows and Mac. The latest version can usually be purchased online as either a download or a kit.</p>
          
        </div>
        
        <div class="qna">
          
          <p class="question">Which piano tutorial software did you use to produce the piano video demos, and are the notes and fingering hints the same as in the sheet music?</p>
          
          <p class="answer">I used Synthesia, a popular piano tutorial software which can be an effective and empowering alternative for anyone having trouble reading sheet music. The notes and fingering shown in the video demos are perfectly identical to those shown in the sheet music and MIDI files. If you are an existing Synthesia user, you may wish to download the MIDI files and import them into Synthesia.</p>

        <div class="qna">
          
          <p class="question">Do you have any other transcriptions? For other instruments? From other Mario games? From other video games? From anything else? Do you have plans to publish any more in the future? Do you take transcription requests?</p>
          
          <p class="answer">Unfortunately, due to a lack of time and fluency with the transcription process, "no" is the answer to all of these questions. What I published on this website is the product of a one-off painstaking effort that I pursued as one of many different kinds of personal challenges.</p>
