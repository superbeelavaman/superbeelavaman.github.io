Dragon Ball is a manga series about Goku exploring the world on a quest for the Dragon Balls. He often does other things in his spare time, such as fighting in the Strongest Under The Heavens Martial Arts Tournament. When the 7 Dragon Balls are collected together, a dragon named Shenlong appears and grants one wish, then the 7 balls will spread out far across the land and turn into rocks for 1 year. The first time Goku obtained the Dragon Balls, he used the wish to bring his friendâ€™s dad back to life. His later wishes were also to help his friends, as his friends are what make him who he is.
